# 🚴 Ola Bike Ride Demand Forecasting Using Machine Learning

**Welcome to the repository of my mini-project!**
This project predicts Ola bike ride demand patterns across Bangalore, using machine learning to enhance urban mobility for riders and Ola.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Predicting ride demand can:

* Improve ride availability
* Reduce wait times
* Optimize driver allocation

We use historical data (2022–2024) + real-time inputs like weather and calendar data to make accurate predictions.

## ✨ Key Features

### **Smart Predictions**

* Forecast ride demand using time, place, weather, day status, and temperature.
* Dynamic integration of real-world data sources.

### **Powerful ML Model**

* **LightGBM Regressor** for high accuracy and speed with large datasets.
* Hyperparameter tuning + evaluation via **R²**, **RMSE**, **MAE**.

### **Dynamic APIs**

* **Google Calendar API**: Detects holiday or working day.
* **OpenWeather API**: Fetches real-time temperature for given date, time, and location.

### **Interactive Web Application**

* Flask backend with HTML/CSS frontend (Ola-inspired theme).
* Users enter date, time, location — system fetches API data & predicts instantly.

### **Scalable & Ready for Deployment**

* Model saved using **Joblib** and **Pickle**.
* Modular design for integration into larger systems.

## 🛠 Technology Stack

**Languages & Libraries**

* Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, LightGBM, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

**Workflow**

* Data cleaning & preprocessing (missing values handled)
* Encoding & scaling
* Model training & evaluation

**APIs**

* Google Calendar API
* OpenWeather API

**Web**

* Flask backend
